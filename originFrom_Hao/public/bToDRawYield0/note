use a+b fit instead of A(R+(1-R)) fit format.
add in trigger cuts, add vertex z < 15 cut, trkEta<1.5 rather than 2.
for MC, use no weight for invariant mass fit.
change Dpt vs. ptHat cut for histogram that use ptHat weight.
fix a small line to assign bin error as 1 in normalize().
for high pT, the direct side band method need some minor scalings:
1. the signal Gaussian might be wider than signal region;
2. the swapped need to be subtracted;
3. the combinatorial background could be not linear.
